## Capstone Project  
**Enhancing Coast Guard Remote Radio Tower Sites Using SDR (USCG C5I Service Center)**  
Designed a deployable SDR solution using a **USRP B205mini** to consolidate multiple legacy VHF radios into a single, software-defined platform for remote Alaskan sites.  

**Technical highlights:**
- Built an SDR pipeline capable of reproducing conventional radio features  
- Reduced hardware footprint, maintenance load, and power usage  
- Integrated AIS → NMEA decoding into a real-time ArcGIS Pro operational picture  
- Implemented MMSI de-duplication, course/speed tracking, and vessel visualization  

> This capstone demonstrates ability to build full-stack technical systems: RF → signal processing → data parsing → geospatial intelligence.
